colr_	corresponds to color vectors

dir_	corresponds to a direction. This may be part of an enumeration (dir_cube_directions_t),
		or even a vector describing the normal vector of a plane, or the direction of the face of a cube.

fixd_	corresponds to a fixed VECTOR or POINT. It is a set of three (or four) values that are not to change
		but rather to be used as starting constants or transformations.

scal_	corresponds to scalar values.
		Items with scalar values should be used for the purpose of mutating vectors and matricies
		They should not be used as vectors themselves or anywhere else where scalars might be inappropriate

trans_	corresponds to transformable VECTOR and POINT values. It is a set of three (or four) values that are to be
		changed
